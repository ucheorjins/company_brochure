# AI Company Brochure Generator

An AI-powered agent that navigates a company's website, intelligently selects relevant pages (like "About Us" or "Careers"), scrapes the content, and generates a cohesive marketing brochure using GPT-4o-mini.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Navigation:** Doesn't just scrape the home page; asks the AI which sub-links are relevant to a brochure.
- **Web Scraping:** Uses `BeautifulSoup` to clean HTML and extract readable text.
- **Content Synthesis:** Aggregates multiple pages into a single context.
- **Streaming Output:** Writes the brochure to the console in real-time.
